🚀 Energetic and adaptable, I proactively handle diverse responsibilities, prioritize effectively, and achieve team objectives collaboratively. Competent in SQL programming and analytical tools like Excel, Tableau, and Power BI. Proficient with databases like MySQL and Microsoft SQL Server, as well as familiarity with cloud tech like Snowflake for agile data navigation. Seeking to leverage my analytical ability and communication skills to drive data-driven insights for business growth. 📊

🔍 I thrive on tackling intricate projects that merge analytical thinking with creativity. One standout venture involved leading a team to develop a Smart Ticketing System for Short-Distance Transportation for enhancing user experience in BMTC city bus transportation in Bengaluru. This project aimed to revolutionize the manual ticketing process and significantly reduce costs by eliminating the need for expensive ticketing machines (which can cost around ₹10,000 per device). Instead, we introduced a conductor-authenticated QR ticketing system through a dedicated portal, streamlining the process and enhancing efficiency within city bus travel. 🎫🚌

🏨 Delving into the hospitality domain, I analyzed revenue insights for AtliQ Grands hotel. My data visualization work using Power BI highlighted the need for dynamic pricing strategies, propelling revenue growth opportunities. Additionally, I explored Airbnb data on Tableau, unearthing correlations between bedroom count and pricing, as well as seasonal revenue variations, all of which unveiled new avenues for revenue optimization. 🏷️📈

🌱 Beyond my analytical pursuits, I am deeply committed to community well-being. I volunteered with NSS, spreading vaccination awareness and joining initiatives like Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, planting trees, and leading public awareness campaigns. Trained in first aid and leadership at The Bharat Scouts and Guides, advocating against tobacco and drugs. These experiences shape my holistic problem-solving approach and passion for impact. 👥🌍

# Hi, I'm Monica 👋🏾 👩🏾‍💻

I'm a software engineer who is passionate about making contributing to open-source more approachable, creating technology to elevate people, and building community. Some technologies I enjoy working with include ReactJS, Jamstack (JavaScript, APIs + Markup) and GraphQL. In 2020, I was selected to be an inaugural <a href="https://stars.github.com/">GitHub Star 🌟</a> based on my involvement in the tech community.  My interest in the React ecosystem led me to launch <a href="https://www.reactrobins.com/">React Robins</a>, a community for women and non-binary ReactJS developers.
